Everything stays private, and it will always remain so. In short, this app is completely secure (**developers’ word**). 🔒\n\n### 💸 **Free for Everyone!**\nThe app is made available to everyone **for free**, without any charges.\nI asked the professional community, and they told me for something like this they would charge something like **₹6 lakhs (INR)**, **€2000** etc to develop. But I’m not earning anything from this app lol.\nThis is an app **by the students and for the students**, and it would be nothing without the **contributors** who provided the notes. **They are the real developers of this app.** 👏\n\nSo please, **show some love** and share this app with your friends!\n\n### 🎉 **Special Thanks**\nI want to extend a special thanks to **[Sekhar Parida](https://www.instagram.com/sekhar.in_?igsh=NzZjOWRpNjVxeGlm)** for their incredible support and contributions. 🙌\n\n## 🤝 **How You Can Contribute**\nThis is a student-driven app, and we’re still missing some notes for certain branches and subjects. You can help us make it better!\n\nHere’s how you can contribute:\n\n- **Join our WhatsApp group**:\n  [Click here to join](https://chat.whatsapp.com/DDuQv0UAkKpBmXB29fBjLw) 📲\n- **Reach out to me**:\n  My socials are listed in the **About** page of the app. 🌐\n\nEven sharing **one file** would mean a lot! You’ll also be credited for your contributions. Let’s work together to make this app even better for all IGIT students. 🙌\n\n### 🛠️ **Missing Credits?**\nIf you’re a contributor and your name or URL hasn’t been added to the contributors' list, I’m sorry! Please DM me, and I’ll update it as soon as possible.\n\n![Students Collaborating](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:500/1*l-lCzn_E6dTqbYRKOC8lHw.gif)\n\n",
