All your data stays private and will remain so, always. In short, this app is completely secure (**developersâ€™ word**).\n\nThe app is made available to everyone **for free**, without any charges. I asked the professional community, and they told me that something like this would cost at least **â‚¹6 lakhs (INR)** or around **â‚¬2000â€“â‚¬5000** to develop. And I am not earning anything from this app lol. Iâ€™m not bragging; I just request you to show this app some love. This is an app **by the students and for the students**â€”and it would be nothing without the **contributors** who provided the notes. **They are the real developers of this app.**\n\n### Special Thanks\nI want to extend a special thanks to [Sekhar Parida](https://www.instagram.com/sekhar.in_?igsh=NzZjOWRpNjVxeGlm) for their incredible support and contributions.\n\n---\n\n## You Can Contribute!\n\nAs this is an app **by the students**, itâ€™s still missing some notes for certain branches and subjects. You can help us make it better!\n\nHereâ€™s how you can contribute:\n- Join our [WhatsApp group](https://chat.whatsapp.com/DDuQv0UAkKpBmXB29fBjLw).\n- Contact me directly through any of my socials (check the About page).\n\nEven sharing a single file would mean a lot! Youâ€™ll also be credited for your contributions. Letâ€™s work together to make this app even better for all IGIT students. ðŸ™Œ\n\nIf you are a contributor, I apologize if your name and URL are not added to the contributors' list. Please DM me, and I will update it as soon as possible!\n\n---\n\n![Students Collaborating](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:500/1*l-lCzn_E6dTqbYRKOC8lHw.gif)\n\n",
